# Adidas Sales Dashboard - Excel Project
This project was created as part of the **Dash & Tell Bootcamp by Nexo Girls**, and showcases my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Microsoft Excel.

## Introduction
I created this dashboard to tell the story behind Adidas' sales from 2020–2021. It shows how products performed, which regions brought in the most revenue, and how sales varied over time.
This project helped me improve my Excel skills, especially with pivot tables, slicers, and clean formatting, and gave me a better understanding of building dashboards that actually communicate insights, not just numbers.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains Adidas sales records across different regions, products, and retailers. It includes key fields like invoice dates, region, product categories, sales methods, operating margins, and total sales values.

## Dataset Source
This dataset was provided as part of the **Dash & Tell Bootcamp** training program and contains Adidas retail sales data from 2020–2021. It was originally sourced from Kaggle's Adidas Sales Dataset. It is meant for educational purposes only.

## Objective
The goal of this dashboard was to analyze Adidas sales performance across the US by retailer, region, product, and sales method, in order to identify growth opportunities, and improve profitability.

Key tasks included:
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Interactive dashboards
- Consistent formatting & branding (Adidas-themed)

## Data Cleaning

Before visualizing the data, I:
- Converted the dataset into a proper Excel table
- Removed empty rows and columns
- Checked for missing values using filters
- Checked for duplicates
- Created two new columns from the Invoice Date:
  - **Month**
  - **Day of the week**
- Applied consistent formatting (e.g., currency columns, general text)
  
## Charts & Visualizations
Below are the visuals created for the dashboard with consistent design using different shades of gray to match the Adidas brand.
