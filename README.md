# Adidas Sales Dashboard - Excel Project
This project was created as part of the **Dash & Tell Bootcamp by Nexo Girls**, and showcases my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data with Excel.

## Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to to analyze Adidas sales performance across the US by retailer, region, product, and sales method, in order to identify growth opportunities, and improve profitability.
  
Key tasks included:
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Interactive dashboards
- Consistent formatting & branding (Adidas-themed)

## Data Cleaning

Before visualizing the data, I:
- Converted raw data into a structured Excel table
- Removed empty rows
- Checked for and removed duplicates
- Created two new columns (extracted from Invoice Date):
  - **Month** 
  - **Day of the Week**
- Converted the various columns to the proper format
- Checked for missing values using filters

## Charts & Visualizations

Below are the visuals created for the dashboard with consistent design using different **shades of gray** to match the Adidas brand.
